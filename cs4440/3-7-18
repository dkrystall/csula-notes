pg 14, subscript for tau should be n+1, not n=1.
Guessing burst times is based on previous Events
Guess is arbitrarily started, pg 16 of ch5 notes puts it at 10.
So the first guess is usually pretty random.

the longer ago the event was, the lower its score impacts your guess.

if n = 360, the first event(360) would weigh on your current tau would be small.
