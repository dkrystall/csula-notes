Page size considerations:
Small page sizes lead to large table sizes
i/o overhead, each time an item is swapped from mem to hard disk or vice versa, cpu scaling is the overhead
locality - what is put in one page. If the page is big, everything can fit in the one page. Locality is good in this case.
    If the page size is too big, it can't share the space with other processes. That's bad.
