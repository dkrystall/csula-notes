Bounded Buffer -
  Insert() - Add's elements into the buffer, has a method to go until the buffer size matches the elemtns
  Remove()  - Removes things from the buffer based on the out size until in == out, which should be the amount that was inserted
  Insert and Removed are usually used together

Interprocess Communication(IPC) - Sync's these methods ^

Communication Models - Processes can share memory, Done by some synchronization, will see later.
Can sync with java/cpp

unix: to display processes do:
  ps -al | grep "nano"


process sharing:
  Direct Communication is like a phone call (1 to 1)
  Indirect Communication - like a public post somewhere (1 to many), usually async

Blocking - sync
non-blocking - async

Remote Procedure Calls - Used with cpp to talk to things
Remote Method Invocation - Used by java

Socket - concatted IP + Port: 192.168.0.0:80
Socket ports under 1000 are usually reserved
