Charges.
    Charge is neutral when equal amounts of positive and neg charge are present

    When the balance is broken, the object appears charged.
    When P > e-, obj is positively charged 
    when P M e-, obj is neg charged.

    most metals are conductors. Conductors let charge pass easily through the medium, along with heat.

    Insulators prevent charge and heat from moving easily.

    semi conductors are somewhere in the middle.

    When an uncharged object approaches a charged object, the like charge is repelled to the opposite side of the charged object.
    Then the opposite charge is on the side closer to the charged object.

Induction.

    Charged object  Uncharged Object no longer evenly distributed
            +      -+
           + +    -  +
            +      -+
        Then the uncharged object moves away from the positively charged object, if there was a copper wire to ground, extra positive charges will leave
        Then the uncharged object will be negatively charged.

        Without any ground to remove protons, the object remains uncharged after it leaves the electric field.
        
Charged objects always attracts uncharged objects..

Coulombs Law F = k(q1*q1) / d^2 
k = 9.0 * 10^9 N //In Air 

Net force between a charged and uncharged object is always toward the charged object .

    Charged object  Uncharged Object no longer evenly distributed
            <----------->  Longer distance, the repellant force will be weaker.
            +   NET F   -+
           + +   <-    -  +
            +           -+
            The shorter distance, the attraction is greater. 

d = 15 cm 
F = .220
Qb = 4Qa 

F = k(q1*q2) / d^2 

.220 N = k(q1q2) / .015 m 

.220(.015) = q/2
q = .220(.015) / 2
a) q = .00165 C 

Total Q = .0033 C
