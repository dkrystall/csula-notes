Electrical Potential Energy 

    Measured as a scalar value

    (negative)PE(change) = PE Final - PE Initial 

PE = mgh, g = field strength

PE/m = gh, describes the field.

To describe an electric field we remove the test charge.

Potential is high close to the positive charge 
Low close to the negative charge
