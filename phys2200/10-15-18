E = pJ = pl/A
1.72I10^-8 * 1.67 A   / 8.2*10^7 = .0350 V/m
EL = .0350


E = V/d 

V = I R   1.67A = V/R 

V = E L  L = 50
V = 1.75 V 
R = 1.75/1.67 = 1.0479 * 50

R = pL / A    A = cross sectional area 

EMF = J/C 

if a batt is 12V, it's the emf ( script E)
voltage drop around circuit must match source voltage.
V = E - Ir (emf - Ir)
