Work(electric) = F(E Field) DOT d(distance) cos(Θ) = -PE 

Negative Work done by the E field is equal to the change of potential energy 

-W(E) = PE , W(E) = -PE 

ΔPE = -W(energy) = -[inf,r]∫F(E)dr 
                 = -[inf,r]∫K Qq/r^2 dr = kQq∫dr/r^2 = -kQq (-1/r|)[inf,r]]
             ΔPE = kQq / r
             ΔV = ΔPE /q = kQ/r = V(final) - V(initial) = V-V(inf) = V - 0 = V, at finite distance, r.

Potential Energy is not an inverse square law. 
PE is scalar

A conductor has the same potential energy everywhere.
