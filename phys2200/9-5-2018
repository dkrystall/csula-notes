Flux is the electric field in relation to a surface.
Flux can be positive or negative, depending on what kind of charges are under the surface of the object.
No Charge, No Flux.

With opposite charges in a box(1e 1p), the net flux = 0.

The enclosure does not effect the net flux. If you have one charge in a penny and one charge in an elephant, the flux will equal

A = |A|ň
ɸ = Ě·Ā = EAcosɸ, dot product defines parallelness.

net electric flux is directly proportional to the net charge in a surface.
net electric flux is independent of the size of a closed surface

surfaces are infinitely thin in regard to flux passing through them
2.0 X 10^3 N/C

COS 0 = 1
A = .1

net flux through any closed surface is 0 if there's no charge inside
