conductors and insulators
    conductors - conductos can pass eleectricity, copper is a good one. Van degraff 
    insulator - nylon, insulators are bad at passing charge 
    Current kills you, voltage isn't so bad. 

opposites charges attract, like charges repel 
ground - accepts an 'infinite' amount of charge without changing its potential, stays at zero charge 

F = k |q1q2| / r^2 

test charge: Infinitesemally Small Positive Charge.  One unit is 1.6 * 10^-19
Won't have any effect on the EF you're trying to test.

What's the EF at a point in space: Think of it as putting a test charge there. 

r vector always points toward the point being tested 

EF = 1/4piϵ₀(q/r²)ṝ

think of p as a test charge. r vector always points toward p(test charge)

E = 1/4piϵ₀(q/x²)î + 1/4piϵ₀(q/y²)ĵ + 1/4piϵ₀(q/z²)ǩ

Workshseet pg 2:

Use coulombs law to figure out the charge to pass

dĒ = 1/4piϵ₀(dQ/r²)ȓ = 1/4piϵ₀(dQ/x²+a²)ȓ
dE = 1/4piϵ₀(dQ/x²+a²)
dE𝗑= dEcos⍺
dE𝗑 = 1/4piϵ₀(dQ/x²+a²)cos⍺

dE𝗑 = 1/4piϵ₀(dQ/x²+a²)(x/√(x²+a²))

ƛ⩰ Q/2pia <- circumference 
dQ = ƛds  ds is a piece of the circumference of the hoop

dE𝗑 = 1/4piϵ₀(ƛx /(x²+a²)^(3/2))
E𝗑 = 1/4piϵ₀(ƛx /(x²+a²)^(3/2)) |2pia tp 0|∫ 


Ends up being coulombs/meter 




cos⍺ = x /√(x²+a²)
