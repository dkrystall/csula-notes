EMF - 
Electrical Field gives off work so PE decreases.
Electric Field does positive work and moves electrons
Battery does negative work inside 

I = Îµ / (R + r)
C = Q/V ,
    When Capacitor's fully charged, PD = Max = voltage of battery, then I = 0.

Current is the same throught the circuit 

Capacitors share voltage in series 
Resistors share voltage in series 

In series, Total R = R1 + R2 +....

In Parallel, Total 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 
                     R = V/I(Total)
In Parallel, Total C =  Ca + C2 

In Parallel, I total = I1 + I2  = V/R1 + V/R2 

Steady Case: After everything is stable (Much time has passed)

Switch Closed: t = 0
Short time after closed 
q, i , Vc 
Vr will change with time (Transited Stage)
Long TIme,
All are stable, no more chanve (Steady Stage)

Total Potential Difference in a circuit = 0 

Midterm question , 26.51 

Magnetic Fiels go from North to South 
Magnetic field lines are closed loops, no start no end. 

Magnetic Field represented by B.

x - into the board
o - out of the board

F(magnetic force) = q V x B , where q = charge, V = Velocity, B = Magnetic Field
