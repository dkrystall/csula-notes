A uniform electric field exists in the region between two oppositely charged plane parallel plates. A proton is released from rest at the surface of the positively charged plate and strikes the surface of the opposite plate,
1.60 cm distant from the first, in a time interval of 3.2*10^-6 s. 
a) Find the mag of the electric field.
b) Find the speed of the proton when it strikes the negatively charged plate.

Proton Mass = 1.67*10^-27kg 
d = 0.016 meter 
t = 3.2*10^-6 seconds 
1 charge{e} = 1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs
Proton charge = positive 
electron charge = negative 
Fc = k q1q1/d^2 
F(electric field) = qE = eE = F(net) = ma 

Δx = V(initial)*t+1/2(at^2)
