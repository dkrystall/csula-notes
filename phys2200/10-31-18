120/240 volt split phase wiring supply
L1+N = 120v
L2+N = 120
L1+L2 = 240

What do you buy from the power company?
    converted from the mechanical to electrical energy and storing it 

output of tranasformers are dependent on frequency of the lines 
    if it varies too much devices burn out

t1 = RC*.6931

tau = RC (Resistance * Capacitance)

C = 0.971 uF 
R = 1700 Ohms 
.64*10*2^-3
time per box = 2 ms / box 
t1 = 1650.7 

1.14*10^-3

capacitor in series = derivative
in parallel = integration 

incandessent bulbs aren't good at converting heat to light
flourescent lights are good at converting heat to light 
led lights are the best at converting heat to light 

Power = I^2 R

Power = VI 

120W = 120V I 

V^2 / P  = R
