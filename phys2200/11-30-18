Direction of enduced EMF 
    Sign of phi is positive with increasing B Field 
    Counter Clockwise is positive 

EMF of Positive dPhi/dt is negative 

Is enduced emf clockwise or counter clockwise?
Clockwise.

decreasing, induced emf goes clockwise if its into the page.

eddy currents make loops/circles. 

cross products are about circulation 

Mutual Inductance
steel acts like a lense in a coil.
self-inductance:
    circuit with a coil that carrys variable current: self-induced emf 
    magnetic energy density = (Magnetic Field Magnitude)^2 / 2(magnetic constant)    u = B^2 / 2μ₀
    Vab = ldidt 

positive lobe of square wave decays in rl circuit.
inductor causes voltage to become negative.
