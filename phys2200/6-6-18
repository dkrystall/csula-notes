Electric Flux: How many field lines are captured by a surface area.

    magnitude = area 

    Larger area, more flux, greater magnitude. 

    The smaller the area, the smaller the vector will be.

    The area vector is perpendicular to the surface.

    Maximum Flux: 
        Flux = E dot A cos(0) = E dot A , where E = Electric field, and A = area vector 

    Zero Flux:
        Flux = E dot A cos(90) = 0, where E = Electric field, and A = area vector 
    
    You have an intermediate flux when the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees.

Guass Law:
    F = k(q1q1) / d^2 
        k = 9*10^9 (Newton*meter^2 / Coulomb^2)
        k =  1 / 4pi ϵ₀ = 8.81 * 10^-12  = Coulomb ^2  / Newton*Meter^2 

When answering questions, always start with the formula 

Area A = LW = .4 * .6 = 0.24 m^2 

Flux = Ệ · Â  = EAcos(Θ)  theta = 70 degree 

Electrical field from a point charge 

E(Electric Field) = kq/ d^2 
  = 1/4piε0 * q/d^2 

Electric Flux = Ê·ÂcosΘ 
              = E 4pi*d^2*cosΘ = E*4pi*d^2 
              = q(enclosed)/ϵ₀ = q/ϵ₀
        E = 1/4piϵ₀ * q/d^2 

Electric Field from Infinity large charged plane 

charged density (σ) = q/A , where q = charge, and A is area in meters squared.

Total Electric Flux = ∑ of all flux 
    Flux = EAcos(0)+EAcos(90)+ EAcos(0)   //cos90 is 0, so middle term is cancelled 
    Flux = 2EA = q(enclosed) / ϵ₀ = 
                 q(enclosed) = σ*Area 

    Density will usually be given 

Gauss Law: 
    Gauss's law does not consider the charge outside the guassian surface 
    inside the gaussian surface, the total charge is the sum of all individual charges. Positive will cancel negative charges.
    Any charges outside of the surface will not effect the total charge.
    outside charges don't contribute to flux. 

Electrical field fomr infinitely long charged wire
    The electric field is perpendicular to the wire.
    The wire is infintely long, the total charge would be infinity.
    Hence why we have charge density. This is within a certain lenght/area.

    Flux = Flux(left) + Flux(Side) + Flux(Right)
         = EAcos90 + E(2pi d*l)cos(0) + EAcos90 
         = E(2pi*d*l)
         Apply Gauss Law 
         = q(enclosed)/ϵ₀ = λl/ϵ₀ 
         E = 1/2piϵ₀(λ/d)
