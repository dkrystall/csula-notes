network layer
    switches only check MAC address.
    Routing: plans trip from source to destination
    Forwarding: Sends a packet from input port to output port 
    Routing:
        knows whole network topology, what's the routing path?
        kind of like driving, whats the best path?
    Fowarding: focuses on one individual router, based on ip and table it finds the correct port
        like how the mailman finds your house on his route.
    Forwarding Table:
        has header value and output links, maybe distances 
        How to calculate distance to destinations?
            Distance Vector, Dictionary Algorithm.
        Checks table to see what range the IP is in, if it's in a certain range it'll send it to teh corresponding prt 
        Longest Prefix Matching:
            Finds the ip that has the longest identical parts. 
            only compares IP with the longest prefix match. 
            In Class Practice 
                int 0 00 000000 -> 00111111 2^6, 64 addresses
                int 1 010 00000 -> 01011111 2^5 32  
                int 2 011 00000 -> 01111111 2^5 32 
                int 2 10 000000 -> 10111111 2^6 64
                int 3 11 000000 -> 11111111 2^6 64
                0 has 64, 1 has 32, 2 has 96, 3 has 64.
