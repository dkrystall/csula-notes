TCP Tahoe, Drops congestion to 1
TCP Reno, Cuts the ssh threshold to half.
cwnd - congestion window size 

TCP Congestion Control: 
    Slow Start: 
        Cwnd starts at IMSS, cwnd doubles every RTT, if no loss or triple duplicate ACK until reaches the ssthresh. Increases sending speed exponentially.
    Congestion Avoidance / AIMD Period:
        Additive increase multiple decrease (AIMD): after the slow start to the threshold, cwnd is eqivalent to ssthresh, and they both increase linearly.

    TCP Tahoe:
        At Time Out: cwnd resets to IMSS, ssthresh is half of the existing threshold.
        3 duplicate ACKs: Same as Timeout
    TCP Reno:
        At Time Out: cwnd resets to IMSS, threshold cut down to half.
        3 duplicate ACJs: cwnd and ssthresh to 1/2 

a) Slow start operates at 1-6 and 23-26.
b) 7 to 22
c) trip ACK, cut in half.
d) Timeout, set to 1
e) 32
f) 25
g) 14 = 28/2
h) ||||/|| Round 7
i) cwnd = 8 @ 26, After 26 cwnd/2 = 4. thresh@26 = 14, after 26 = 14/2 = 7
