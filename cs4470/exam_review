given m = 12, p a
nz = ev
m is original text, ascii code 12 in this case. 
e is the number that has no common factors with z.

when given p and q, you need to calculate n and z.
if p = 5, q = 7.
then n = 35 = p*q
z = p -1 * q-1 = 4*6 = 24
e = z
cypher text of e = 17

given character a = 53, what is p and q, what is range of e and d? 
what is a cypher text?
