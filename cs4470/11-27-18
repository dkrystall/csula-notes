srvivability - how well a service can handle failing
99.999% uptime is 5 mins down a year
working path and backup paths should be disjoint (completely disjoint)
types of disjoints
    path-based protection (totally disjoint)
    link-based protection 
        each node will have a backup path, that reconnects with the original path.
    working/backup paths 
    shared-backup
    dedicated backup - each user is assigned a backup path
    shared backup - each user shares a bucket of paths.

find disjoint working and backup paths
    run dijkras alg, then remove the active path and rerun the alg to get backup
