1) 10 Mbps = 10000000 bits/second single switch, packet size = 5000 bits = 5 Kb, 
Propagation delay = 10 microseconds = 10x10^-6 seconds, immediate retransmission
Start -> Switch(Ethernet) -> End 

    a) 5 kbits / 10000kbps = .00005 seconds = 500 microseconds
        this is then multiplied by 2 because the switch needs to retrieve all the data before retransmitting
        transmission + Propagation delay = 500*2 + 10 = 1010 microseconds
        Total Transmission time = 1010 microseconds = 1.01 ms 

    b) Transmission speed + Propagation delay of 3x switches 
        Start -> Switch 1 -> Switch 2 -> Switch 3 -> Destination
        1000 + 10 + 1000 + 10 + 1000 + 10 + 1000 = 4030 microseconds = 4.03 ms 
    

    c) cut through - doesn't have to store all the data first:
        (.2 kbits / 10000 kbps) + 10Âµs prop delay+ (4.8kbits / 10000kbps) = 20 + 10 + 480
        Total time = 510 microseconds = .51 ms


        40,000 Km = 40,000,000 m 
2) Host A <--------->B (40,000 km away)
Propagation Speed = 2.5 * 10^8 meters/seconds, Transmission Rate R = 5 Mbps.

    a) How long to move a packet of 1000 bytes from A to B 
        Packet = 1 KB = 8 KBits
        R = 5000 Kbps 
        No processing/queue Delay 

        Prop Delay = 40,000,000 meters /  250000000 meters / second   = .16 Seconds = 160 ms
        Transmission Time = 8 Kbits / 5000 Kbps = .0016 seconds = 1.6 ms 
        Propagation Delay + Transmission Time = .16s + .0016s = 161.6 ms
        Total Time = 161.6 ms 

    b) How Long does it take to move packet 'L' over distnace 'd', propspeed 's' and trans rate 'R'
        typical time = L/R + d/s 

    c) Trans time = dtrans, prop delay = dprop, Host A transmits at time t=0, at time t=dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet?
        If there's no queue delay, the last bit will be just entering the Propagation pipe, D = 0m
        let D = Total Propagation Distance
        Last bit is at:  D - (D / (dprop - dtrans)
        first bit = 1 bit / 5Mbps = .0000002 = 0.2 microseconds 
        25000000m/s * 

    
    d) dprop > dtrans, at t=dtrans, where's the first bit?
        first bit = 1 bit / 5Mbps = .0000002 = 0.2 microseconds
        250000000 m/s * .0000002 = 50m

    e) dprop < dtrans, at t = dtrans, where is the fist bit?
        The first bit is at the start of the Propagation Link, D = 0
    
    f) Bandwidth Delay R*dprop 
        R * LinkDistance/propspeed
        if R = 5 Mbps, D = 40,000 Km, propSpeed = 2.5*10^8m/s 
        5000000 * 40000000 / 250000000 = 800,000 bits 

    g) packet size = 1,200,000bits = 1.2 Mbits  
    If there's 1 bit every 50 meters, and the line is 40,000 km 
    The maximum number of bits that can be held is 800,000 bits.

    h) 50 meters
