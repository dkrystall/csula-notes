NAT Terms: Network Address Translation

NAT Terms:
    Inside Local: typically a RFC 1918 IP address ie. 192.168.1.X 
    Outside Local: Address that the source host is known on the internet. (Search on google in terms of cisco networking)
    Inside Global: Source host address used after the local address is translated to access the internet. 
    Outside Global: The Destination of the outside address 

NAT Overloading (Port Access Translation):
    Uses ports to figure out where to send packets 
    There can be multiple TCP ports assigned to the same machine on a network
    So the Router can have ~65,000 TCP Port Connections, but not necessarily 65,000 devices connected to it.

To setup static NAT Configuration:
    ```
    ip nat inside source static 10.1.1.1 170.46.2.2 
    !
    interface Ethernet0

TO setup Dynamic NAT:

    ip nat pool todd 170.168.2.3 170.168.2.254 
        netmask 255.255.255.0
    ip nat inside source list 1 pool todd  //list 1 is access control list 1

    access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 //Last octet doesn't matter, matches watever.

EIGRP - 

Multicast Packets have an IP, where the first octet = 224 - 239, then the last 3 octet values dont matter.
224.0.0.10 is reserved for Multicast EIGRP Hello Packets
