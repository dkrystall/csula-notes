arp broadcast -
    broadcast packet sent out, hopes something in the domain has the answer.

class c network - 
    utilizes 24 bits, can use 8 bits to assign addresses. 2^8 = 256 addresses.

VLSM networks, 
    a router needs as many ip addresses as its connections to other subnets.
    4 block (/30),
        two IPs used for broadcast and network
        other two for hosts.
    first 27 bits in an address space must be the same in a /27 subnet 

networks: 172.1.4.0, 172.1.5.0, 172.1.6.0, 172.1.7.0
000001 00  .4
000001 10  .6
000001 01  .5
000001 11  .7   16+6 = /22 
first 6 bits in third octet matcj
so with /22, the last 10 bits are free, so the block size is 2^10 
block size: available for hosting

Basic IP troubleshooting:
Ping city 
    Ping the machine from the machine ( ping yourself)
    then ping the router/gateway 
    keep hopping til you can get to the server.

Cisco 2960 switch, 1900 series router
Config:
    enter first time setup
    router> 
    router> enable 
    router#  //# is a good thing, means you can config the router.
        //if there's something else, like a 'password' then it's been previously configured.
        //break into router and perform password recovery
        //reset router to factory defaults.
    router# show flash:  //displays files in flash memory 

when things aren't working, go for the question mark.
