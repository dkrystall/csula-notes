Section on Configuring Cisco Devices 
    If you can do the labs, that's it. 
    
Switches in lab - 3750 
Switches support VTP - VLAN Trunk Protocol 

VLAN Trunk Protocol -
    If you have 5 layer 2 switches, that are all connected by trunk links (1 root, 4 leafes)
    ie. If you wanted to create VLAN 2, by default VLAN 1 would be predefined, and all ports would be in vlan 1.
        Therefore: all the devices would be in the same vlan domain.
    To change settings, You setup a VTP Server with clients, and you can modify the VLANS from the VTP Server.
    
    By default, every switch is setup as a VTP Server. 

    VTP Domain - Name of the space that the cluster of VTP devices are in.
        If you change the server of the domain, it will change everythign else in the cluster. 
    
    `#vtp domain King-Hall` - sets the domain name to 'King-Hall' 

    `#vtp mode (client/server/transparent)`   transparent - Create/Delete VLANs on the switch locally.

DHCP Snooping - Sends out fake IP addresses to users, prevents users from sending traffic passed the default gateway 
When the switch sees an untrusted interface, it will blocked packets. 

#int fa0/1
->  (config-if)
#switchport port-security mac-address   //locks down access to a switch port to a specific mac address. 
    //If you don't know hte MAC address, you can specify a maximum number of mac addresses that can be seen on the port 
    //#swithcport port-security maximum 1, First address the switch sees on the port will be the address. everything else will be blocked.
#switchport port-security violation // what to do when security is violated? 
    protect / restrict / shutdown 

Identity-Based Networking 
    Client has to have credentials for the switch, then will be granted access after verifying with other equipment.

802.1x 
    This allows Identity-based networking using client/server access control 

    Client - 
    Authenticator - Layer 2 Switch 
        Switches only deal with layer 2 traffic.

Default Gateway 
    In a broadcast domain, there's probably only 1 default gateway.
    Change Gateway from clients

Proxy ARP -
    If Subnetmask is 0.0.0.0, every ip address is in the same network as the PC 
    It won't forward packets because it thinks every machine is in the default gateway.
    Acts as the server the client is trying to reach by assigning itself as teh psuedo host the client wants.

FHRP - 
    Kind of like RAID 1 for Routers 

HSRP - 
    Cisco protocol, Has two routers act as one default gateway. 
    Switches the router when one fails by keeping track of some 'keep alive' packets. 
    Configured in the 'standby' of the config-if of the router
    HSRP Virtual MAC-
        Has a virtual ethernet address, based off an HSRP Boot Number 
        standby <group number> 
        many groups so you can have more virtual IP addresses

SNMP - 
    Makes it possible for a network admin to monitor the health of devices on the network.

IP 10.85.16.10
Subnet Mask:
    255.255.224.0
Subnet?

                         // There are 13 0's after the subnet mask, so blocksize is 2^13 
    00001010 01010101 00000000 00000000 = 10.85.0.0 
    //Back to Decimal

Broadcast?
    Set the Host Bits to Binary 1's,

    10.85.31.255
# Hosts?
    2^13 - 2 
1st Host IP?
    10.85.0.1
Last Host IP?
    10.85.31.254


Broadcast Domains - Start at each node, look til it hits a router, 
Collision Domain - Start at each node, look til it hits a router/Switch 
Number of Subnets = Num of Broadcast Domains

Microsoft cmd to display table of ip's and eth addresses = ARP 

list active connections: netstat -na 

configure a stack 

Infrastructure as a service - Just Hardware, you install everything else 
Platform as a service - Hardware and tools, you just install your app 
Software as a service - Provides everything

Voice Traffic is stable, usually never above 64 KBps 

Ethernet Header for Class of Service, can be used with IP Phones, Then in the IP header the switch can change the Quality of Service header 

Queueing 
    Can separate Class of Service packets into different queues
    Then the time sensitive packets will be sent out first. 

Too Much Traffic 
    If there's too much traffic, router starts dropping packets..
    The TCP Layer software module then notices the dropped packets, 
    Then the software slows down the transmission of the packets 
    TCP assumes congestion and slows down.
    To avoid congestion, have the TCP module stop and let everything die for a little bit. Then retransmit.
