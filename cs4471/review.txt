HUBS - Connect wires together
SWITCHES - Break up Collision Domains 
ROUTERS - Breaksup broadcast Domains AND Colission domains
            But they also create an 'internetwork'
            Internetwork - the process or technique of connecting different networks by using intermediary devices such as routers or gateway devices.
            Routers breakup Collision Domains

Layers:
    Top: How App runs 
        Application - UI 
        Presentation - Data 
        Session - Separates Data 

    Middle: Routingto remote Network
        Transport - Delivers Packets 
        Network - addressing for destinations

    Bottom: Local Network Transport 
        Data Link - puts data into Frames 
        Physical - moves bits 

3-way Handshake 
    SYN - Synchronize 
    ACK - Acknowledge 
    1) Client sends SYN to server 
    2) Server replies with SYN-ACK
    3) Client sends ACK to server

Flow Control: Uses a buffer on recieving information.
    Does this by setting a Window size that the client can accept.
    When it's full the packet retrieval stops, then the client sends the server an ACK message to put more data through pipe 

Routers have Routing Tables:
    NET - Netowrk ID 
    INT - Interface (E0 - Ethernet, S0 - Serial )
    Metric - ????
