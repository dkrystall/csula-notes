Static Variables live on the Heap ?? maybe.

Variables can hold user defined abstract data types

Stack Memory - Everything is stored contiguously
Abstract Data Types -
  No implementation, given the fields and methods.

reference types can be Primitive type, String is a primitive type in Haskell
In Java strings aren't primitive types

Linked List
  String - Nodes of characters pointing next to each other
    Memory for these pointers is stored on the heap (So it has to look through a lot of muck)
    As opposed to being stored in a stack, things stored inthe stack on contiguous
Enums
  Sometimes they're coerced into integers(are coerced in c++)

Arrays
  "Ragged" array : Array of Arrays that are different lengths

  Java being "primitive" is debatable.

  * in front of memory location dereferencing, giving the value
  & in front of value, gives address

  C++ no garbage collection
