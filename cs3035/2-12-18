Null-Pointers in java is the only case for pointers in java

Reference types in java:
  reference variables represent objects in memory
  The memory address is for something in the heap
  In Java you can change references. Java references are more like pointers in C++
  Reference Var in c++ is a constant pointer, it never changes.

Can't change pointers, once they're set the address stays the same

Heap Management:
  you never really know how big the heap is going to be so you have to keep track of everything in there.

lazy loading: Calculates things when you need them

Mark-Sweep(Java garbage collector):
  Every pointer in heap has an extra bit, all set to garbage
  Theres a tree of references, after first variable is asked for point, asks the that pointed object if it's pointing to anything
  when pointer is disconnected from cell, Java
  Can call garbage collection whenever you want if instantiate a garbage collector object

Type Checking
  ensures operands of an operator are the appropriate type

Orthogonal, Less Lines is more orthogonal.

2a
  3) False
  4) B
  5) Writability and Expresivity

2b
  1) Whether names are case sensitive
  13) Dynamically Bound
