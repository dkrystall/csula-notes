1) We would have a two dimensional array, the first value would be the word, the second values would be the index the word appears in.
We want to keep the order correct so we would use: Counting, Radix, Merge or Insertion Sort to correct the values/Keys.

Step 1: Get the document
Step 2: When a new word appears, make the word a key, append the index to the values for the key.
Step 3: When a word that's already tokenized appears, add its value to the values for that key.

2)
The Data structure would be a multi-map, an array with sub arrays at each index for values of the map.
The operations would be O(1) because you have the exact index(Key: k) that you're looking up in the map.

get(k):
  k is a key, look up that key in the hashmap, return the values for that key
put(k,v):
  k is a key, v is a value, find the hashed value for k, then insert the values at hashed k in the map.
remove(k,v):
  go to hashed index k in the map, delete corresponding values v.
removeAll(k):
  delete values at index k, then delete k.
