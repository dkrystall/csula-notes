Linear Search(A, u)
  for i = 1 to A.length
    if (A[i] == u)
      return i
  return NIL

Loop Invariant Proof:
  Initialization: set i=0 A[1..0]
  Maintenance:
    1) Before execution of loop A[1..i-1] does not contain key
    2) After the execution of the loop,
      i) if A[i] == key, return i and terminate the algorithm
      ii) if A[i] doesn't contain key, then A[1...i] does not contain key
    3) A[1..i] does not contain the key
  Termination:
    1) if (A[i] == key), return i and terminate
    2) i = A.length+1, A[1...i-1] => A[1...n] doesn't contain the key, return NIL and terminate.
