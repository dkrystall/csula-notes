f(n) : max(f(n), g(n)) = g(n): Θ(f(n) + g(n))
c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n),  n > n₀
case 1: fn >= gn
  If this is the case: c1*f(n)+g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*f(n) + g(n) , c1 = 1/2, c2 = 1

f(n): (n+a)^b =g(n): Θ(n^b)

C1n^b <= (n+a)^b <= C2n^b
c1 = 1, c2 =

3.1-3
  Order of O(n^2) is the upper bound

3.1-4 Is 2^n+1  = O(2^n)?
2^n+1 = 2*2^n, Impossible to find c2 for 2^2n, 2^2n = 2^n * 2^n, exponential growth

3.1-6

Do pg. 61 3-1 to 3-4.
These will be on exam

Start chapter 4 questions
