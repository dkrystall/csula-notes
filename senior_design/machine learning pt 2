cost function, measures how far off data is from the function 

1/2m summation (htheta(x^1)-y^i)
to find minimums of a function you take the derivative.
gradient descent 
when changing your learning rate, assign them to a temp verial=ble first
when the leraning rate's too large, it'll start skipping the minimum 

batch gradient descent

scatastic gradientdescent - upgrades after every training example 

convex function 

batch gradient descent
    EACH STEP USES ALL THE trianing examples.

Logistic Regression Classification 

    sigmoid / logistic function 
    Sigma - greek for s 
    sigmoid - s like 
    data doesn't effect your graph 
    you get the sigmoid by...
    
Advanced Optimizations 
    One-vs-All 
    pick the class with the highest probability.

Overfitting - 
    Have to find a sweet spot between overfitting and underfitting.
    make high exponent terms more expensive by multiplying them by large numbers 
    L2 - Squared
    L1 - absolute value
    or lambda, waits 
    underfitting make lambda smaller 
    overfitting make lambda bigger.

    use yolo v3 with tensorflow, that's the ormat the raccoon thing had 
    lookup TFRecords from videos.
