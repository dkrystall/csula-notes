Reg Ex = Type 3 / Regular
Stack = type 2 / CFL
Turing Machine = Type 1 / CSL 

PDA (Push Down Automaton) - put into stack, remove, must be empty.

sec 2
8) n!
9) n(n+1)/2

review demorgans laws 
Lemmas 
can treat 11/12 P(x) as just p  or q

13) plug in the negation and compare 
14) True 

If you need order, you use Permutations instead of Choices (nCr vs nPr)

How many possible subsets are there of a set? 
You're choosing an element for your subset, so it's binary 
So you choose for however many number of elements for your subset.
So it will be 2^n for your new subset, depending on how many elements 
So if your set has 20 elements, the possible amnt of subsets is 2^20

5) 4, From and To are the key words for this question.

relations are multiplication 

10) 45

11)90


Assign 3 -
Max Heap - Root is the largest amount

Use stack to write inorder,postoeder, preorder traversals

Post Order - L -> R -> Root 

Average Num of comparisons: Take all the nodes, check how many comparisons you have to take to get there, then divide by total number of nodes

do in order and post order, DFS/BFS, tree/graph 
Using linked list delete items/put items 

Lookup minimum spanning tree 

del/insert into max heap tree 

sec 2:

1) 2^(logâ‚‚n) == n 
When taking a recursive function that has 2 calls, you have 2^something 
because the n is divided by 2, the something = logn 

Big O is the upper bound of the function 
Theta is the most tightly fit line of hte function 
Omega is the lower bound of the function 

know sorting algs (merge sort, selection sort, heap)

Implement Hash Table, pass value into hash function, place value into result of function.
If there is collision, implement a linked list to keep them in the same table.

convert tree to array : Use inorder traversals 

lookup how to minimize space complexity

To get negative binary number, flip the bits and add 1.

7)  500/4 = 125 instructions/second 
    750/3 = 250 instructions/second 
    M2 is faster than M1 by factor of 2.

look for parallel computing questions.

11) .9*5 + .1*20 = 6.5

8 = h*5*(1-h)*20 

pt 2, 7) Turnaround Time = Waiting Time  + Burst Time
            80 = W + 26 
            W = 54 
            54/4 = avg time 
    
for 2 way mapping, every phys address is mapped to a set in cache with 2 possible locations 

pt 3 (7,8) Two way associative mapping 

semaphore - used for synchronization 
P = Wait function  (decrements)
V = Signal Function  (increments)
