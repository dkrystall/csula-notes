networks:
    ethernet hubs:
        sometimes go up to 48 ports 
        replicates all incoming traffic to all devices cnnected to the hub 
        acts like a coax network
    connect two comps to a hub -> network
    ethernet cable: RJ45 Ends (8 pins each)
        8 wires along the inside
    Used to use coaxial cables:
        just two conductors, no bueno
        Would have a T conector to connect computers to the coax cable in a series
        need a terminator at both ends of the coax cable
        networks would fail if there was any break in the main coax cable.
